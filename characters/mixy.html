            Hailing from the Xharpu clan in the underdark, Mixy is a frail lil gobbie who acts tough to get by. 
            Unfamiliar with the common customs, he had trouble discerning what is socially acceptable and people often find Mixy rather rude when they cross paths with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a quick read, it's rather easy to discern that he only makes alliances that aid him and will have no second thoughts changing sides when a more alluring opportunity presents itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is still skeptical of the new group he finds himself in, but after his encounter with death, he believes there is safety in numbers and is trying to grasp his new somewhat physically altered self.
